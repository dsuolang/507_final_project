Tree graph

The structure will be a hierarchical system with binary structure. Each node is a condition. For example, start with house type (e.g., single room or multiple rooms), and then each node further separated by more detailed category, such as a square feet, median income of neighborhood etc. The tree will organize the data a based on the home characteristics and show how the home value (above average under avergae) is determined.
